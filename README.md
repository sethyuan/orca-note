## Note

It's currently in alpha testing, so bugs are expected. Please backup your data regularly.

## Running on macOS

Because the app is still in early development, it isn't a signed app yet, to run it, you have to open your system's terminal and execute the following command once after you installed the app:

```
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Orca\ Note.app
```
