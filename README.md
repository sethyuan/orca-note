## Note

It's currently in beta testing so bugs are expected. Please backup your data regularly (Orca Note also automatically backup your data hourly as long as you keep it running).

## Running on macOS

Because the app is still in early development, it isn't a signed app yet, to run it, you have to open your system's terminal and execute the following command once you install the app:

```
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Orca\ Note.app
```

## Community

## Plugin development

If you're a developer and are interested in creating plugins for Orca Note, I have written a [simple-task](https://github.com/sethyuan/orca-simple-task) plugin as a template. It's a fully functional plugin that non-developer users can also use.
